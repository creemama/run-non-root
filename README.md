This allows us to

[**run Docker containers with a non-root user by default**](https://github.com/creemama/docker-run-non-root)

without having to specify a `USER` with hardcoded UIDs and GIDs in our Dockerfiles.

```
Usage:
  run-non-root [options] [--] [COMMAND] [ARGS...]

Run Linux commands as a non-root user, creating a non-root user if necessary.

Options:
  -d, --debug  Â           Output debug information; using --quiet does not
                          silence debug output. Double up (-dd) for more output.
  -f, --group GROUP_NAME  The group name to use when executing the command; the
                          default group name is USERNAME or nonroot; this
                          option is ignored if we are already running as a
                          non-root user or if the GID already exists; this
                          option overrides the RUN_NON_ROOT_GROUP environment
                          variable.
  -g, --gid GID           The group ID to use when executing the command; the
                          default GID is UID or a new ID determined by
                          groupadd; this option is ignored if we are already
                          running as a non-root user; this option overrides the
                          RUN_NON_ROOT_GID environment variable.
  -h, --help              Output this help message and exit.
  -i, --init              Run an init (the tini command) that forwards signals
                          and reaps processes; this matches the docker run
                          option --init.
  -q, --quiet             Do not output "Running ( COMMAND ) as USER_INFO ..."
                          or warnings; this option does not silence --debug
                          output.
  -t, --user USERNAME     The username to use when executing the command; the
                          default is nonroot; this option is ignored if we are
                          already running as a non-root user or if the UID
                          already exists; this option overrides the
                          RUN_NON_ROOT_USER environment variable.
  -u, --uid UID           The user ID to use when executing the command; the
                          default UID is GID or a new ID determined by
                          useraddd; this option is ignored if we are already
                          running as a non-root user; this option overrides the
                          RUN_NON_ROOT_UID environment variable.
  -v, --version           Ouput the version number of run-non-root.

Environment Variables:
  RUN_NON_ROOT_COMMAND    The command to execute if a command is not given; the
                          default is sh.
  RUN_NON_ROOT_GID        The group ID to use when executing the command; see
                          the --gid option for more info.
  RUN_NON_ROOT_GROUP      The group name to use when executing the command; see
                          the --group option for more info.
  RUN_NON_ROOT_UID        The user ID to use when executing the command; see
                          the --uid option for more info.
  RUN_NON_ROOT_USER       The username to use when executing the command; see
                          the --user option for more info.

Examples:
  # Run sh as a non-root user.
  run-non-root

  # Run id as a non-root user.
  run-non-root -- id

  # Run id as a non-root user using options and the given user specification.
  run-non-root -f ec2-user -g 1000 -t ec2-user -u 1000 -- id

  # Run id as a non-root user using environment variables
  # and the given user specification.
  export RUN_NON_ROOT_GID=1000
  export RUN_NON_ROOT_GROUP=ec2-user
  export RUN_NON_ROOT_UID=1000
  export RUN_NON_ROOT_USER=ec2-user
  run-non-root -- id
```

## Installation

Use the following commands to install or upgrade `run-non-root`:

```sh
wget -O /usr/local/bin/run-non-root https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creemama/run-non-root/master/run-non-root.sh
# curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creemama/run-non-root/master/run-non-root.sh -o /usr/local/bin/run-non-root
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/run-non-root
```

## Docker and `run-non-root`

For more information about using `run-non-root` with Docker, see [docker-run-non-root](https://github.com/creemama/docker-run-non-root).

## Thank you, `su-exec`

We use [`su-exec`](https://github.com/ncopa/su-exec/tree/dddd1567b7c76365e1e0aac561287975020a8fad) to execute commands so that the command given to `run-non-root` does not run as a child of `run-non-root`; the command [replaces](https://linux.die.net/man/3/exec) `run-non-root`.

Consider the following examples using the command:
```sh
$ docker run -it --rm creemama/run-non-root:latest --quiet -- ps aux
```

If we changed `run-non-root` to use `su`, the output would be:
```
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 root      0:00 {run-non-root} /bin/sh /usr/local/bin/run-non-root --quiet -- ps aux
   17 root      0:00 su -c ps aux nonroot
   18 nonroot   0:00 ps aux
```

If we changed `run-non-root` to use `exec su`, the output would be:
```
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 root      0:00 su -c ps aux nonroot
   17 nonroot   0:00 ps aux
```

If we use `exec su-exec` (the current way `run-non-root` executes commands), the output is:
```
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 nonroot   0:00 ps aux
```

We use `su-exec` over [`gosu`](https://github.com/tianon/gosu) since `su-exec` does more or less exactly the same thing as `gosu`, but it is only 10 kilobytes instead of 1.8 megabytes; in fact, `gosu` recommends using `su-exec` over itself in its [installation instructions for Alpine Linux](https://github.com/tianon/gosu/blob/caa402be6661f65c93d63bc205bc36ce055558bf/INSTALL.md).

## `tini`

Use the `--init` option to use [`tini`](https://github.com/krallin/tini) with `run-non-root`. `tini` handles zombie reaping and signal forwarding.
